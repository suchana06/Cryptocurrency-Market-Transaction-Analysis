## 🔹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
- **Removed null values and duplicates** for accurate analysis.
- **Converted string-based numeric values** into proper data types.
- **Created derived metrics for deeper insights:**
  - **Price Change (%)** → `(price_change_24h / (current_price - price_change_24h)) * 100`
  - **Market Liquidity Ratio** → `total_volume / market_cap`
  - **7-Day Rolling Average** → Used SQL window functions to smooth trends.
